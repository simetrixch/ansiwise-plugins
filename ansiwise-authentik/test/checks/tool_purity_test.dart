/// tool-purity — this plugin knows the identity provider as a tool and never an application of it.
///
/// It knows the shapes the provider defines for itself: the path every application it stands in
/// front of is served under, and that an application is reached by the slug the provider registered
/// it as. What it may never know is WHICH applications there are, what any of them is called, which
/// label the provider is served under or on which domain — every such name belongs to a program
/// row, never to this package.
///
/// So the scan reads every byte of [scanned] — code, comment and fixture alike — against the word
/// list at [wordList]. The test that decides a word stands at the head of that list: could a vendor
/// with the same tool and a completely different product still use this package with that word in
/// it?
///
/// tool/ is not scanned, and that is the harness rather than a loophole. This check has to name the
/// words it forbids in order to search for them, and nothing under tool/ is compiled into the plugin
/// or shipped with it. It is also why the list is a file there rather than a constant here: a list
/// written into a scanned file would be an occurrence of every word on it.
